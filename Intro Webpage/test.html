After having my daughter at 19, I decided to pursue an education as an Admin. The school I went to previously seemed very good but right before I graduated, took me out of school saying 
I couldn't graduate unless I paid... only about 3 credits left when this happened. I was heartbroken and didn't know any better. Not that it's a great excuse but I trusted the Academic 
Counselor and didn't know better, since my family is newly Americanized. 
<br>
After that failing experience, I decided to press on and eventually worked the next ten years in Admin as my main/career focus in combination to the average odd job in between. About two
years ago, I decided that I had possibly learned all I could as an Admin and I wasn't challenged anymore. I predicted the field would be very data oriented soon and no need / less expensive
to hire a computer or outsource then to keep this position in house. At the same time, there's so much competition that even with a degree here, it wouldn't be worth it (I thought). I 
always loved computers and thought this was the time to investigate a career in the world of computers. After much research, I settled here in the field of programming at University of Phoenix.
It was one of the best decisions I have ever made and boast of the degrees complexity yet the school's supportive enviornemnt at the same time.
