<h1> Love is great! </h1>
<div id="goals">
My greatest goal is to go to the Kingdom of Heaven. But, as we heard in a sermon once, that an empty home no matter how precious doesn't feel like home. Therefore, I want to go with 
everyone. My hope and prayer is that we can all have the opportunity to go to the Kingdom of Heaven together. Yep, everything we are looking for is there --most of us just haven't realized it yet.

In the meantime, I have a goal of creating a mega-corporation. I am sneakily devising the plan to create a brand for the future Papapietro clan. The parent company: Vertical Consolidation. I chose
this name as this is what happens when a company goes in and takes over several types of industries. This seems far fetch now --but didn't Google and Amazon do it? So, I'll be next.
<br>
And without competing! Vertical Consolidation aims to help people become self reliable in organization, technology and domestic affairs. Everyone has their own level of organization and/or reliability 
so that's where we come in to teach you where your realistically comfortable level is at and how to fill in the rest. We are a service connector not  provider. Eeek! Please do not
steal my dream!
